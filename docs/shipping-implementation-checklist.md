# Shipping implementation checklist

Plan: [shipping-plan-2026-09-18.md](shipping-plan-2026-09-18.md).

- [x] M0: preserve operator checkout; reconcile upstream; install dependencies; verify baseline.
- [ ] M1: regressions and fixes for hook, state, lifecycle, integration, plans, and wheel assets.
- [ ] M2: authoritative serial supervisor, bounded recovery, isolated validated integration.
- [ ] M3: normalized idempotent intake and explicit remote delivery policy.
- [ ] M4: installed external-project qualification, failure injection, approved real-agent canary.

## M0 evidence

Original project remains on `main` at `b60e9e8`. Its pre-existing `logs/CHANGELOG.md` edit, untracked plan, and runtime files are untouched. Remote main checked via `ls-remote` and fetched: `2e61e26`, seven commits ahead, no divergence. Implementation branch `codex/shipping-2026-09-18` starts at that revision in an isolated worktree; all seven commits are reused intact.

An archived upstream tree in `/private/tmp/roadrunner-shipping-evidence` with a dedicated Python 3.12 environment passed **241 tests, 1 skipped**, Ruff, mypy (11 files), and ShellCheck. Existing hook tests mutate their source tree, so they ran only in this disposable archive. No real agent or remote mutation was used.

Remaining drift: operator recipes referenced removed `roadrunner.py` (fixed); dev extras omitted mypy/stubs required by `just ci` (fixed). Historical task checks and documentation still reference the former entrypoint. Upstream still has all seven reviewed correctness gaps; baseline green is not release qualification. Next: M1 regression tests before fixes.
