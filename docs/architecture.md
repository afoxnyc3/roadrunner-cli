# Roadrunner CLI — Architecture

## 1. Overview

Roadrunner is a deterministic agentic loop. **Python owns control.** **Claude owns implementation.** **Hooks enforce completion.** No task advances without validation. No loop exits without an explicit signal.

### 1.1 Per-task control flow

1. Claude reads its brief from `CLAUDE.md`.
2. `roadrunner next` → identifies the eligible task.
3. `roadrunner start TASK-XXX` → status `in_progress`, recorded in state.
4. Claude implements the task within the scope declared by `files_expected`.
5. `roadrunner validate TASK-XXX` → runs every `validation_commands` entry. Exit 0 or non-zero.
6. On failure, fix and retry.
7. `roadrunner complete TASK-XXX --notes "…"` → re-runs validation, flips to `done`, writes the work log.
8. Claude finishes its turn. Stop hook fires.
9. Stop hook calls `roadrunner check-stop` (see §2.1). The hook either lets the session end or injects the next task brief.

### 1.2 State files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `tasks/tasks.yaml` | Source of truth for task definitions and status. Schema-validated on load, written atomically (tempfile + `fsync` + `os.replace`), 5 rolling `.bak` files. |
| `.roadmap_state.json` | Current task ID, iteration counter, per-task attempt counter. Carries `schema_version` (ADR-009). Reads/writes guarded by an `fcntl.flock` on `.roadmap_state.lock`. |
| `.context_snapshot.json` | Written by PreCompact (§2.3), verified by PostCompact (§2.4). Carries `schema_version`. Provides cold-resume state if a session crashes mid-task; not consumed by SessionStart, which reads `tasks.yaml` live to avoid stale-snapshot poisoning. |
| `logs/CHANGELOG.md` | Append-only audit trail of status changes. Rotated on the task boundary when over 10 MB. |
| `logs/TASK-XXX.md` | Per-task work log with validation output. Authoritative history; not rotated. |
| `logs/trace.jsonl` | Structured per-event JSON trace. Rotated, retained 7 days. |
| `.reset_TASK-XXX` | Boundary marker written on task completion. |

## 2. Hook Contracts

### 2.1 Stop (`hooks/stop_hook.sh`)

**Fires:** after every Claude response turn.

**Input (stdin):** Claude Code runtime payload — `stop_hook_active` flag + `last_assistant_message`.

**Output (stdout):** JSON control object. Two distinct shapes:

```json
// Soft block — keep the loop running. Used for resume briefs, next-task
// briefs, blocked-task reports, and "all done, please emit ROADMAP_COMPLETE".
{"decision": "block", "reason": "Continue working. Task TASK-002 …"}

// Hard stop — terminate the session entirely with stopReason. Used only
// when the iteration cap is reached.
{"continue": false, "stopReason": "Max iterations (50) reached."}
```

`{"continue": false}` overrides any `decision: "block"`. Never emit both in the same payload.

**Exit codes:** `exit 0` is the norm; the JSON on stdout carries the decision. The hook also exits 0 with no JSON in three cases: `stop_hook_active=true`, `ROADMAP_COMPLETE` matched on the last non-empty line, or after printing the iteration-cap payload.

**Logic** (delegated to `roadrunner check-stop`):

1. `stop_hook_active=true` → exit 0.
2. Increment iteration counter; check against the cap.
3. `ROADMAP_COMPLETE` on the last non-empty line of the last assistant message → exit 0 (ADR-001).
4. In-progress task → emit a resume brief (auto-block after 5 attempts; ADR-003).
5. Eligible `todo` task → emit a task brief.
6. Blocked tasks → report with unblock instructions.
7. Non-`done` tasks remain → report anomaly.
8. All `done` → prompt Claude to emit `ROADMAP_COMPLETE`.

### 2.2 SessionStart (`hooks/session_start_hook.sh`)

**Fires:** when a Claude Code session begins or resumes (including after compaction restarts).

**Output (stdout):** JSON with `additionalContext` containing a turn-1 directive — resume brief for an in-progress task, "next action" prompt for an eligible todo, blocked-task report, or `ROADMAP_COMPLETE` prompt when all tasks are done.

```json
{
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "SessionStart",
    "additionalContext": "Continue working on TASK-003 …"
  }
}
```

Reads `tasks.yaml` live rather than `.context_snapshot.json` — a stale or missing snapshot must not be able to produce a misleading directive. Resets the per-session iteration counter so the new session's first Stop-hook fire sees `session_iteration=1` (ROAD-010). Always exits 0 — informational, never blocks. Delegates to `roadrunner session-start`.

### 2.3 PreCompact (`hooks/precompact_hook.sh`)

**Fires:** before Claude Code compacts the conversation.

**Side effect:** writes `.context_snapshot.json` so a crashed or interrupted session has cold-resume state on disk. PostCompact (§2.4) verifies it survived; SessionStart deliberately does not consume it (§2.2).

**`.context_snapshot.json` schema (v1):**

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "snapshot_at": "2026-04-15T09:00:00Z",
  "current_task": "TASK-003",
  "iteration": 7,
  "next_eligible": "TASK-004",
  "status_summary": {"TASK-001": "done", "TASK-002": "done", "TASK-003": "done", "TASK-004": "todo"}
}
```

PreCompact does not support `additionalContext` — restoration after compaction relies on Claude Code's own conversation continuity, not the snapshot.

### 2.4 PostCompact (`hooks/postcompact_hook.sh`)

**Fires:** after Claude Code completes context compaction.

**Side effect:** verifies `.context_snapshot.json` survived and emits a `post_compact_verify` event to `logs/trace.jsonl`. PostCompact does not support decision control, so this hook is purely observational and always exits 0. Delegates to `roadrunner post-compact`.

### 2.5 PostToolUse (`hooks/post_write_hook.sh`)

**Fires:** when Claude uses Write or Edit. Matcher: `"Write|Edit"`.

**Behavior:** lint feedback to Claude on the next turn. `.py` files → `ruff check`; `.yaml`/`.yml` → safe-load validation (path passed via `argv`, never interpolated). Non-blocking.

## 3. Trust Boundary

`tasks.yaml` is **executable configuration**. The `validation_commands` list is run via `subprocess.run(cmd, shell=True)` — every command runs with the operator's full privileges. This is by design for a single-operator tool: the operator authors the tasks, the operator trusts the commands.

- Treat `tasks.yaml` like a Makefile or CI pipeline. A `rm -rf /` entry will execute.
- Validation commands are subject to a configurable timeout (default 300s; per-task `validation_timeout`) so a hanging command cannot block the loop indefinitely (ADR-008).
- Task IDs are validated against `^[A-Z]+-\d+$` on every load to prevent path traversal in derived filenames (`logs/{task_id}.md`, `.reset_{task_id}`, git branch names).
- Roadrunner assumes the person writing `tasks.yaml` is the person running it. No access control, no sandboxing, no approval flow. Appropriate for local development and overnight runs on a single machine; not appropriate for shared infrastructure.
